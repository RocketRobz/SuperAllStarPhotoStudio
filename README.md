What happens when you take the concept of *Super Smash Bros.*, and turn it from a fighting game, into a photo shoot party?     
The result, a *Super All-Star Photo Studio*! Take pictures of your favorite all-star characters, in any location possible!

*Super All-Star Photo Studio* has it all: An all-star video game cast, well-known outdoor and indoor locations, stylish girls, the coolest of TWL himself, and fan-favorites like like Mario & Luigi, Sonic & Tails, Banjo & Kazooie, and even Waluigi!

# What is this?

*Super All-Star Photo Studio* is basically an upgraded version of the *Style Savvy* series's photo studio feature, with added characters and locations outside of said series. You can also change the character's expressions and poses, though *Super All-Star Photo Studio* does not support changing expressions.
- As of currently, only Grace (from *Style Savvy*) has changeable poses.

# Features

- High-resolution *Horizon HD* (800px wide mode), exclusive to 3DS, New 3DS, and New 2DS consoles!
- Pre-rendered characters and backgrounds, as well as music, from     
  - Super Mario     
  - Sonic the Hedgehog     
  - Pac-Man     
  - Banjo-Kazooie        
  - Style Savvy     
  and more!
- Around/Nearly 100 characters and 50 locations.
- The first homebrew appearance of Robz' fashionable twin, Rabz!

# Adding custom characters

- **DS(i):** `.png` files go in `sdmc:/_nds/SuperPhotoStudio/characters/` ([Example here](https://github.com/RocketRobz/SuperAllStarPhotoStudio/blob/master/nds/nitrofiles/graphics/char/ss4_Robz0.png))
- **3DS:** `.t3x` files go in `sdmc:/3ds/SuperPhotoStudio/characters/` (Made from three `.png` files, examples here: [zoom0](https://github.com/RocketRobz/SuperAllStarPhotoStudio/blob/master/3ds/assets/gfx_chars/characters/Rocket%20Photo%20Shoot/Spring/zoom0/Robz.png), [zoom1](https://github.com/RocketRobz/SuperAllStarPhotoStudio/blob/master/3ds/assets/gfx_chars/characters/Rocket%20Photo%20Shoot/Spring/zoom1/Robz.png), [zoom2](https://github.com/RocketRobz/SuperAllStarPhotoStudio/blob/master/3ds/assets/gfx_chars/characters/Rocket%20Photo%20Shoot/Spring/zoom2/Robz.png))
