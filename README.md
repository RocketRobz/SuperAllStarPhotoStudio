What happens when you take the concept of *Super Smash Bros.*, and turn it from a fighting game, into a photo shoot application?     
The result, *Super Photo Studio*! Take pictures of your favorite all-star characters, in any location possible!

*Super Photo Studio* has it all: An all-star cast, famous outdoor and indoor locations, stylish girls, the coolest of TWL himself, and fan-favorites like Waluigi!

# What is this?

*Super Photo Studio* is basically an upgraded version of the *Style Savvy* series's photo studio feature, with added characters and locations outside of said series. You can also change the character's expressions and poses, though *Super Photo Studio* does not support changing expressions.

# Features

* High-resolution Hori-HD (800px wide mode), exclusive to 3DS, New 3DS, and New 2DS consoles!
* Pre-rendered characters and backgrounds, as well as music, from     
  * Super Mario     
  * Sonic the Hedgehog     
  * Pac-Man     
  * Banjo-Kazooie        
  * Style Savvy     
  and more!
