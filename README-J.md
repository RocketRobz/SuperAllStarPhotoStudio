Modeling for photos is always fun, but what if you wanted to invite more people over? What if you invited over characters from the previous *Girls Mode* entries?     
How about unexpected guests, like Mario & Luigi, Sonic & Tails, Banjo & Kazooie, or any other character not found in the *Girls Mode* series?     
The photo shoot party becomes bigger and more fun, in a *Photo Shoot X-over!*

# What is this?

*Girls Mode: Photo Shoot X-over!* is basically an upgraded version of the *Girls Mode* series's photo studio feature, with added characters and locations outside of said series. You can also change the character's expressions and poses, though *Photo Shoot X-over* does not support changing those, as it would be time-consuming, as well as taking up more space.

# Features

* High-resolution Hori-HD (800px wide mode), exclusive to 3DS, New 3DS, and New 2DS consoles!
* Pre-rendered characters and backgrounds, as well as music, from     
  * Super Mario     
  * Sonic the Hedgehog     
  * Pac-Man     
  * Banjo-Kazooie        
  * Girls Mode     
  and more!
* Around/Nearly 100 characters and 50 locations.
* The first homebrew appearance of Robz' fashionable twin, Rabz!
